# PHP Skeleton Kata

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through
practice and repetition. The term was probably first coined by Dave Thomas, co-author of the
book The Pragmatic Programmer, in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.

## Start new PHP Kata

```bash
composer create-project bernardosecades/php-skeleton-kata /your-app-directory/my-kata dev-master
```

Then add your classes to 'src/Kata' and your test cases to 'tests' and run 'php bin/phpunit' to run your tests.
